                                     ARRAYS 
Defination:-  Array is a collection of similar elements...   

1. An array is a collection of data items of same type.

2. Items are stored at contigous memory locations.

3. It can also store the collection of derived data types, such as pointers, struture, etc.

4. A one dimensional array is like a list.

5. A two dimensional array is like a table(matrice).

6. The C language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array...

7. Some texts refer to one-dimensional arrays as vectors, two-dimensional as matrices, and
   use the general term arrays when the number of dimensional is unspecified or uniportant...

   IMPOTANT:- Arrays index starts with 0...





                           WHY DO WE NEED ARRAYS:-

1. Code that use arrays is sometimes more organised and readable...

2. If you were to store the marks in a test of 56 variables will make program look cluttered and messy...

3. Solution to this is arrays!

4. We can create arrays of integers and store the consecutive marks corresponding to the roll number in array...

                 
                 
                                ADVANTAGES OF ARRAY

1. It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name...

2. Accessing an item in a given array is very fast!

3. 2 Dimensional arrays it ease in mathematical application as it is used to represent a matrix.

                            PROPERTIES OF ARRAY:-




1. Data in an array is stored in contiguous memory locations...

2. Each element of an array is of same size...

2. Any element of the array with the given index can be accesed very quickly by using its address
   which can be calculated using the base address and the index...
